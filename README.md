# SafePath
Empowering Independence, Ensuring Safety

SafePath is an intelligent monitoring and assistance system designed to support elderly individuals with cognitive decline (such as dementia or Alzheimer’s) and provide peace of mind to their caretakers.

---

## Inspiration

As people age, cognitive and physical challenges make independent living harder. Many elderly individuals struggle with facial recognition, forget important tasks, or unknowingly wander beyond safe areas. This causes stress and fear for loved ones and caretakers.

SafePath was built to bridge this gap—enabling independence with safety using a combination of real-time geofencing, AI companionship, and facial recognition.

## What It Does

SafePath integrates multiple smart features to provide a robust elderly care solution:

### Geofencing Alerts
- Notifies caretakers in real-time when the elderly person crosses predefined safe zones.
- Ensures rapid response if wandering occurs.

### Facial Recognition
- Identifies whether a person is a known individual or a stranger.
- Provides visual aid to the elderly for recognizing familiar faces.

### Caretaker Connectivity
- Real-time dashboard for caretakers to receive alerts, track location, and stay updated on their loved one’s safety.

### Google Gemini AI Chatbot
Acts as a virtual assistant for:
- Friendly conversation and companionship
- Setting reminders
- Answering questions in a natural and supportive way
